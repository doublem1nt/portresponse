              <p>My name is Jonathan Yee and I am an aspiring software developer whose portfolio includes a variety of projects from my current curriculum in UCLA's extension program for Web coding. My professional experience or work history includes a long tenure in Aviation / Aerospace sales where I built myself from the ground up and excelled into a Sales Manager position.</p>
              <p>Growing up on the west coast, I always aspired to attend a 4 year University program and was lucky enough to be accepted to the prestigious California UC, in Riverside. During my stay, I was afforded the opportunity to participate in many new experiences, such as on membership in on campus fraternities and clubs. Besides exiting with a Business Marketing Degree, I left UCR with an open mind and passion to explore various paths and remain flexible in my continous climb towards a successful future. </p>
              <p>My interests in Technology has always driven my curiousity in the field, whether it involed playing video games or working with hardware. Building PC for my friends and coworkers has always been a side hobby.</p>
              <p>After five years of success at my first job out of college, I decided I would make the bold move to attend UCLA's Extension program and try my hand at software programming. At this time I remain open to exploring more facets of the technology industry and I hope I am able to display my value through my performance. My unending drive to improve will prove me to be a good investment for my future employers, as demonstrated in my work experience.</p>
