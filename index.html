              <p>My name is Jonathan Yee and I am a photographer whose portfolio is filled with a wide variety of subjects including (1) animals, (2) food and (3) people. My professional experience in the industry began as a hobby, stemming from my eternal love for photography and the arts. Previous to my current work, I have enjoyed taking photos of friends, landscapes and nature. One specific passion of focus would be photographing the curious on goings of the domesticated pet.</p>
              <p>Growing up on the west coast surrounded by multi-cultural influences, I always intended to attend a 4 year University program and was lucky enough to be accepted to one of the prestigious California, UC schools. As a UC Riverside Business Marketing Major, I was afforded the opportunity to take photos of on campus life, a unique natural environment of the school's surrounding orange groves and many graduation ceremonies. I have always found the excitement from on campus events as an amazing opportunity to capture in photos. </p>
              <p>As your future photographer, I intend to hold initial meetings with the client to get a grasp of the event I am contracted to shoot. Getting close with subjects and obtaining context will allow me to capture signficant moments effectively. Your satisfaction is my focus and guarantee. </p>
