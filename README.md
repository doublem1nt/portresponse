# Responsive Portfolio

Project to design website for Photographer's portfolio. Website requires dedicated page to (1) introduce and describe Client/professional, (2) to display a small set of photos to display the client's past work and (3) a contact page for interested parties to reach out for business inquires. Website must be mobile friendly and have a nav bar which can easily navigate the pages in the small (mobile), medium and large viewports. 

## Installation

The asset directory runs adjacent to index.html. 
Within asset folder, you'll find IMAGES directory. 
In IMAGES directory you will find 8x image files. 
>> Please maintain this orientation for INDEX.HTML to operate properly.
