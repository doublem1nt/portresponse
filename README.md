## Responsive Portfolio

Project to design website for Photographer's portfolio. Website requires dedicated page to (1) introduce and describe Client/professional, (2) to display a small set of photos to display the client's past work and (3) a contact page for interested parties to reach out for business inquires. Website must be mobile friendly and have a nav bar which can easily navigate the pages in the small (mobile), medium and large viewports. 

## Description
Hi, this is my portfolio, I hope you like it! Originally, this application was a basic homework assignment under my coding boot camp. It has been revamped to display my portfolio, biography and resume.
